# Crafting Rules

## Value / Cost

Characters have to gather rescources from monsters to create enchantments of varying rarity.

| Monster CR	| Rarity	  | Mod 	| Value			        	|
| ---		      | ---		    | ---  	| ---			          	|
| 0 - 1/2   	| Common  	| 10	  | 0 - 5 gp			      |
| 1 - 4		    | Uncommon	| 100  	| 100 - 400 gp		    |
| 5 - 10	    | Rare		  | 500	  | 2500 - 5000 gp	    |
| 11 - 16	    | Very Rare	| 1500	| 16500 - 24000 gp	  |
| 17 - 20	    | Legendary	| 10000	| 170000 - 200000 gp	|

## Base Item

An enchantment can only be placed on an item of sufficient quality. The quality of a base item determins the enchantment slots of a magic item.

A base item costs an additional 10% of the final magic item.

### Attunement

- AC on non armor/shield slots
- resistance
- immunity
- regeneration
- class specific effect
- cast spell X 3 or more times a day
- Ability Score improvement
- spell recovery
- spell absorbtion
- spell reflection
- proficiency
- expertise
- vision exept darkvision
- speed if you do not already have the chosen movement option

Consumable items do not need attunement

### Crafting Consumables:

250gp / 2h
Max. 1000gp / day
Half cost / value (rare consumable value 2500gp. Costs 1250gp and 20h / 2,5 days to craft)

### Crafting Magic Items:

250gp / day
you have to pay half the value of the magic item you wish to craft. for example: rare item value 5000gp if you take the time to craft it, you have to provide 2500gp. the process takes you (5000/250) days.


### Bonus

magic item price formula

(base price * slot amount)* slots above first = gp

example 3 slot rare item:
(5000gp * 3) * 2 = 30000gp

example 4 slot rare item:
(5000gp * 4) * 3 = 60000gp


### Permanent Magic (WIP)
